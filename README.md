## How to Set Up and Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the DefiLens landing page using Next.js:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

You can check if they are installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using `git`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DefiLens/defilens-landing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   After cloning, navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd defilens-landing
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Next, install the required dependencies. You can use either `npm` or `yarn`:

   - Using npm:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Using yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Next.js development server by running the following command:

   - With npm:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - With yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn dev
     ```

   This will start a local development server, and the application should be running on:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Build for Production (Optional)**

   To create a production-ready build of the app:

   - With npm:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

   - With yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn build
     ```

   After building, you can start the production server with:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

6. **Environment Variables (Optional)**

   If the project relies on environment variables, make sure to add them in a `.env.local` file in the root directory. For example:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
   ```
